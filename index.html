    <p>Hi there everyone, my name is
        <u>Jon Arbuckle</u>. I am 30 years old and am the proud owner of a cat named
        <b>Garfield</b> and a dog named <b>Odie</b>. Garfield is a fat lazy cat who loves to eat while odie is a dog without a brain. Although my pets drive me <em>crazy</em> I cant imagine life without them.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        I spend half my time going to the grocery store to feed Garfield. I have to make sure to buy all his favorite foods like pasta and
        <b>lots and lots</b> of lasagna. When I get home Garfield tries to attack me and get everything in my bag before I put it in the fridge. One time he ate all the food in 30 minutes and I had to go back to the grocery store. <i>I wasnt very happy about that</i>
